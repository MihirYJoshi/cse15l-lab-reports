Installing VS Code:
I did not install VS Code on my computer because I had already had it installed. When I first installed it, I went to VS Code's website and downloaded the file that I needed for my Macbook. I then unzipped the application and dragged it to my application folder. I have used VS Code to clone repositories and commit changes that I have made to code in my other projects.

Remotely Connecting to the Server:
I first ssh into the server with my account name. The name is cs151wi23aio and I needed to add @ieng6.ucsd.edu as that is the server that I needed to ssh into. I entered yes because it was my first time. I then entered the password assiciated with it.

I was then logged in and was welcomed. I saw some information on CPU usage and Cluster Status

I then created a new folder called folder1 in the home where I used the terminal commands to run python and print txt files. I also copied, moved, and removed the files around the folder
