Installing VS Code:
I did not install VS Code on my computer because I had already had it installed. When I first installed it, I went to VS Code's website and downloaded the file that I needed for my Macbook. I then unzipped the application and dragged it to my application folder. I have used VS Code to clone repositories and commit changes that I have made to code in my other projects.

Remotely Connecting to the Server:
I first ssh into the server with my account name. The name is cs151wi23aio and I needed to add @ieng6.ucsd.edu as that is the server that I needed to ssh into. I entered yes because it was my first time. I then entered the password assiciated with it.

I was then logged in and was welcomed. I saw some information on CPU usage and Cluster Status

I then created a new folder called folder1 in the home where I was planning on running the terminal commands to run python and print txt files. I did pwd to find my current directory and cd to change to the home directory. I created a python file that prints hello world using vi and then used python to run the file. THis printed out hello world. I then removed the file and listed the files out. I then did cd.. to return to the source folder and created a new hello world file outside the folder.

I then changed into folder1, removed the hello world file that was inside and moved the hello world text file that i created into the folder from the home directory. After returning to the home directory and printing the present working directory, I printed all the files on my account (including hidden) using ls-lat and my current files (without hidden) and info using ls-ltr. I then used -a to print hidden files. I then used cat to print hello.txt

I did cd .. to exit the folder and ran an ls command to list all the other computers that are on the server. However, I cannot connect to those servers because I do not have the permission to do so.

I also copied hello.txt from the outside folder on to my computer and ran a cat command to display the files' contents
